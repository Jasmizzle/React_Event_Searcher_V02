React Advanced Project Event Searcher. This is the last project for the front-end development course from Winc Academy.
Make sure the front-end and the back-end servers are working. 
Use: NPM run dev to open the front-end server
use: dir to see if event.json is in the list
Use: json-server --watch events.json to open the backend server.
This was a project where you can search for an event or make your own event. 
For this project I used the following:
React router (to give structure to the pages)
React for the components
A mock API using a JSON-server
Chakra UI to make the app looks great
